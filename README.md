# Liquid Level indicator

Basically automation in systems would help reduce wastage of resources in various ways, one such way for the prevention of wastage of water resource to control the water tanks from overflow. In this automated world, the handling of any kind of devices with comfort is made to be the easiest factor everywhere. Considering this aspect of comfort zones and the prevention of wastage of resources, a design of an automated overflow control circuit unit was proposed. The proposal was designed on the perspective of controlling the flow of water into the tanks automatically.
